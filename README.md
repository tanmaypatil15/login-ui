# Login UI â€“ Basic HTML Design
This Login UI is a basic static webpage created in 2019 as a practice project during my education. Developed using simple HTML and CSS, it focuses solely on the visual layout of a login page without any backend functionality. This project marks one of my early attempts at understanding and designing user interfaces.
